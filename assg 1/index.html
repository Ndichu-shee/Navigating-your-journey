<p>Patricia is not afraid of breaking the rules set about a white and a black having sexual relations but instead she even gets pregnant and gives birth to the child. She is not afraid of bringing up the child alone <i> both the mother and the father</i> Patricia engaged with ladies who practiced dirty business as a means of survival, she even goes to club at night where she met with white men who paid rent for the women. At the point of giving birth, she lies to the doctors that the father is from Swaziland and does not put Robert's name on the birth certificate and Noah does not carry a Xhosa name either. Noah’s mother was ready to protect whatever and whoever belonged to her, when Noah drank the bottle of grapes and a bag of Eucharist she went and defended Noah yet it was a mistake, she challenged the authority and questioned the system of the school since the only authority she recognized was God's.</p>

<p>She believes that she can do anything to make her son happy. When Fufi goes to another home she gave the woman who claimed the dog was hers money so as she could give back the dog to make Trevor happy. She didn't allow people to come against her and her child because of their color, she could fight back by talking the same language to the people who thought they were thieves in the market. This extended to his son who understood and overcame whatever he was told by people along the streets.

Nambuyiselo meaning <i> She Who Gives Back </i> illustrate a sense of giving back, she would help the abandoned kids where they could collect empty bottles and turn them for a deposit and buy food in the shops for them to eat. She also bought Trevor books and taught him English so he could be free anywhere he went and this led to him loving every single book. Patricia was a good displinarian, she could beat her son for every mistake he made and could not spare him.

She easily adapted to change, for instance when her father took her to her aunt's home, she adapted to the change of work, food and freedom. She knew a lot of languages which made her to fit in where ever she went and interacted with the people in the different places. Patricia shows her love for education when she goes to study and yet in those times education for the black was not allowed and eventually she becomes a secretary she even buys her son many books to study and taught him how to read the Bible.

Patricia is good example of today’s world, she is unstoppable, determined to go for whatever she believes in.She is a good role model to ladies in that she shows the power of believe in oneself and not to care and even listen to what other people say to us and be proud of the way we are every day.</p>
